# SOCKS

SOCKS proxy server library provides a comprehensive suite of functions, methods,
and structures for building and managing SOCKS proxy servers. The idea is to
allow developers to easily create, configure, and deploy SOCKS proxies for
secure, anonymous internet communication.

## What is SOCKS?

SOCKS is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client
and server through a proxy server. [...]. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies
TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets
to be forwarded, in version 5. A SOCKS server accepts an incoming client
connection on TCP port 1080, as defined in [RFC
1928](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1928).
